 * SW Design with Java.
 * 
 * An architect is designing a room that will have a row of alternating black and white tiles 
 * on the walls.  The architect would also like for the first and last tiles in each row be black.
 * Each tile is 5‚Äù wide.
 * 
 * Write a program that calculates how big the gap on each end of a row should be given 
 * a specified total width of the wall.  The program should also specify how many black 
 * tiles and how many white tiles will be needed for the row.
